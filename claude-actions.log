2025-08-28: Implemented BuildSpy - A comprehensive Go-based build system monitoring tool with real-time process tracking, flame graph visualization, CPU/memory monitoring, thread inspection, and web dashboard. Supports Make, Ninja, CMake, Bazel, and other build systems with automatic detection and performance analysis.

2025-08-28: Fixed flame graph visualization - Enhanced real-time updates with proper D3.js implementation, interactive tooltips, dark theme UI, hierarchical process tree layout, and improved WebSocket event handling for smooth real-time monitoring.

2025-08-28: Modified program lifecycle - BuildSpy now continues running after build completion, keeping the web server active until all browser connections close or Ctrl+C is pressed. Added build completion events and graceful shutdown handling.

2025-08-28: Redesigned visualization for performance - Replaced hierarchical flame graph with real-time timeline chart showing process durations, CPU usage opacity, throttled updates (4fps), reduced noise by filtering low-CPU events, and added build summary stats with active/completed process counts.

2025-08-28: Fixed tooltip issues and command parsing - Tooltips now properly disappear on mouseout with improved cleanup, global mouse handler, and better z-index. Also fixed command argument parsing to support quoted commands like "./buildspy -cmd 'make -j16'" by splitting the command string properly.

2025-08-28: Added build completion indicators - Web viewer now shows clear build status with animated completion notification, build progress counter, visual completion marker on timeline with green "BUILD COMPLETE âœ…" label, and pulsing animation effect when build finishes successfully.

2025-08-28: Split buildspy into two-component architecture:
- buildspy: CLI tool for capturing build metrics to BadgerDB database
- buildspyd: Daemon serving web dashboard for historical build analysis  
- Added multi-run management with search and filtering
- Implemented persistent storage with BadgerDB for long-term retention
- Created comprehensive web interface supporting both live and historical views
- Added REST API and WebSocket endpoints for programmatic access
- Built complete Makefile system for two-binary build process

2025-08-28: Refactored codebase to eliminate code duplication:
- Created proper Go package structure with shared packages
- Moved models, database, monitoring, and config into separate packages
- Eliminated 3x duplication of models.go and database.go files
- CLI and daemon now import shared packages instead of duplicating code
- Fixed flag conflicts by renaming verbose flags from -v to -verbose
- Successfully tested both CLI tool and daemon with new architecture
